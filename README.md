# UI Application (How to run)

## Introduction
This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the Flask application. Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python, ideal for building small to medium-sized web apps.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
First, clone the repo to your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone [URL of the Git repository]
cd [repository name]
```

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to run Python projects in a virtual environment to manage dependencies. To set up a virtual environment, run:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
- On Unix or MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`

### Install Dependencies
Install all required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application
To run the Flask application, use the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```
The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.
